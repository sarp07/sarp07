Hello! üëã

I'm Sarp, and I'd like to start by telling you a bit about myself. I live in Antalya and was born in 1994. I entered the software industry in 2011 by creating simple websites. I discovered blockchain in 2012 and developed a significant interest and curiosity about Bitcoin, which prompted me to advance my skills in this area. I have worked in the advertising and signage industry for many years. After running my own company and providing website services, I believe I have significantly developed my skills. In the projects I work on, I prefer to achieve more practical and original results rather than sticking to conventional routines and problem-solving methods. Satisfaction is one of the most important elements for me. The projects I work on must first satisfy me so that they can also please the project owners. I offer services in turnkey corporate sites and blockchain DApp projects. If you would like support or assistance in these areas, you can reach me via email or on Instagram.

## About Me
I am primarily an expert in web software and blockchain. I have officially four years of experience. I actively started in the blockchain sector with the Bitranium project, which was shelved before development was completed. I have developed my skills and participated in many projects. I currently provide freelance and project-based services. I am new to GitHub and will share my open projects here. My experience is mainly focused on front-end development, but I can also provide services in PHP and JS for Backend issues. I can provide API services (JSON API) for mobile and web applications. I also have expertise in MySQL.
